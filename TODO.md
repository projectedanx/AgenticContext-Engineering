# TODO

This file contains a list of suggestions for future enhancements to the Agentic Context Engineering Workbench.

## Features

-   **Import/Export Context**: Add the ability to import and export the entire agent context (instructions, knowledge, tools, memory, and state) as a JSON file. This would make it easier to share and reuse contexts.
-   **Version History**: Implement a version history for the context editors, allowing users to revert to previous versions of their context.
-   **Tool Validation**: Add validation to the Tool Editor to ensure that the tool definitions are valid and complete.
-   **Real-time Collaboration**: Add support for real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on the same agent context simultaneously.
-   **More AI Models**: Add support for other AI models, such as those from OpenAI and Anthropic.
-   **UI/UX**: Improve the overall UI and UX of the application.

## Testing

-   **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for all components and services.
-   **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests to ensure that all components and services work together correctly.
-   **End-to-End Tests**: Add end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions and ensure that the application works as expected.

## Documentation

-   **API Documentation**: Add API documentation for the `geminiService.ts` file.
-   **Component Library**: Create a component library to document all the components in the application.

## Deployment

-   **Dockerize the application**: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application for easier deployment.
-   **Deploy to a cloud provider**: Deploy the application to a cloud provider, such as Vercel or Netlify.
